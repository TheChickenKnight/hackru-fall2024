## Inspiration
It started with one of our teammates having interest in NeuroTech, specifically Dyslexia, however we shifted over to Alzheimer's.
## What it does
It is a website which contains a list of tools to help retain memory and record in your stead. It also comes with a log in system to keep track of one's reminders/personal memories.

### Features
#### Memory Cards
A set of user-inputted (anyone with account) flash cards that help in the practice of remembering.
#### Reminders
A calendar of recorded dates.
#### Mood Tracker
Keeps a record of one's emotions to look upon later.
#### Personalized Music Playlist
User-inputted playlist to induce recognition.

## How we built it
We build a Next.js application with Tailwindcss and Mongodb, with a mix of typescript and Javascript.

## Challenges we ran into
We had trouble with merge conflicts and such causing the entire project to go defunct. However we were able to salvage our work into another repository.

## What we learned
We sharpened our skills on full stack development.

## What's next for Alzaid
- To create a more secure log in system
- better tools based on real data
- Voice-assisted tools.
